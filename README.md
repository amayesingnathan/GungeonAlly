# GungeonAlly

GungeonAlly is Blazor Server Web App for aiding your adventures in Enter the Gungeon.

## Installation

Clone the repository in order to download and run the app. Start the GungeonApp.WebScraper project to download all required data into a SQL Server database
and start GungeonApp.WebApp in order to run the web app.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/amayesingnathan/GungeonAlly.git
```

I created this app purely for personal use and runs on a Raspberry Pi in my home network, so it is not hosted anywhere publicly. 
Whilst I could run this in the cloud, I intend to add a fully automated build and setup 
script to allow users to download and set up the web app as a locally run application.
